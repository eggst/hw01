# Emily Stroh BIO  


*Emily Stroh, MAPSS Anthropology; University of Chicago* 

Homework week 1, **October 8th, 2018**, *Computing for the Social Sciences*; Instructor: Benjamin Soltoff.

## Introduction:  
Having earned my bachelors degree in Anthropology at the University of Michigan, I am now working towards a masters in Anthropology at the University of Chicago, as part of the Master of the Arts Program in Social Science MAPSS. My interests are ecclectic and wide-reaching, encompassing topics such as…

* Pop Culture
* South Korea and the Korean Wave
* Urban Centers
* Globalized Society and ‘Monoculture’
* Pop culture as an export
* International Relations
* Gender, Sexuality and Language Ideologies as they appear in and influence pop culture.


In the future, I hope to pursue a career path with global policy making and NGO involvement that may foster positive international relations through the increasingly powerful use of technology.

In my free time I enjoy reading fantasy novels, writing (everything from manuscripts, plays, poetry, music, and more), dancing, and finding new music.
